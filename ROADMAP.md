## 🎯 Implementation Plans

### 1. 4K/8K Resolution Support ✅ READY TO START
**Priority: HIGH** | **Complexity: LOW** | **Est. Time: 3-5 days**

#### Objectives:
- Add 4K (3840x2160) and 8K (7680x4320) resolution options
- Optimize patterns for high-DPI displays
- Ensure patterns scale properly without pixelation
- Add pixel density tests for 4K/8K displays

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Update Python resolution dictionary with 4K/8K options
- [ ] Create HTML patterns for 4K resolution
- [ ] Add high-DPI specific test patterns:
  - [ ] Sub-pixel rendering test
  - [ ] 1:1 pixel mapping test
  - [ ] High-frequency detail patterns
- [ ] Optimize file sizes for web delivery
- [ ] Test on actual 4K/8K displays

#### Technical Approach:
```python
# Add to crt_test_suite.py
RESOLUTIONS = {
    # ... existing resolutions
    '6': (1920, 1080),   # Full HD
    '7': (2560, 1440),   # 2K/QHD
    '8': (3840, 2160),   # 4K/UHD
    '9': (7680, 4320),   # 8K/UHD-2
}
```

├── css/
│   └── generator.css   # Styling
├── js/
│   ├── app.js         # Main application logic
│   ├── patterns.js    # Pattern generation algorithms
│   ├── canvas.js      # Canvas rendering
│   └── export.js      # Export functionality
└── assets/            # Icons, fonts
```

#### Features:
- [ ] Pattern selector with live preview
- [ ] Customizable parameters:
  - [ ] Colors (RGB/HSL pickers)
  - [ ] Grid spacing
  - [ ] Line thickness
  - [ ] Pattern complexity
